# Utolay
 An Amatsuka Uto app to commemorate her return.
 
 ## Description
 
 A cute Tenshi overlay so that you can listen to her even when she's not streaming.
 You can choose to have it play her BGM and/or have her "talk" when you tap on the overlay.
 A few screenshots from my phone because that should explain it easier.
